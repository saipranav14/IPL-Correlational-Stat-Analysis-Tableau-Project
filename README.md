# IPL-Correlational-Stat-Analysis-Tableau-Project
ABOUT:

I have gathered and cleaned ball by ball stats of all IPL matches from the last three seasons (IPL 2018 - IPL 2020) and fed it into Tableau to curate fascinating insights on player performances. 

The following are some of the correlational analysis that I have performed:

1)"Match Wise Batsmen Run Split Up" & "Match Wise Bowler Wicket Split Up" 
    - To visualize how each batsmen/bowler has fared against each opponent on the given day
2) "Batsmen vs Opponent (Innings Wise)" & "Bowler vs Opponent (Innings Wise)"
	- To visualize how each player performed innings wise i.e while Chasing/defending
3)"Batsmen vs Bowler" & "Batsmen vs Bowler run split up"
	- To visualize how each batsmen has fared against each bowler 
	- To visualize how many dots/singles/boundaries each batsmen has scored against each bowler
4)"Over Wise Batsmen Run Split Up" 
	- To visualize during which phase (Power Play/Middle/Death) of the game has the batsmen scored the most
5)"Venue Wise Run Scorers" & "Venue Wise Wicket Takers" 
	- To visualize at what venues does a player score maximum runs/takes maximum wickets
